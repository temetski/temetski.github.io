I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in {{ page.coss }} chair at ETH ZÃ¼rich.
Previously, I also worked as a data scientist at the Analytics, Computing, and Complex Systems lab ([ACCeSs@AIM](https://aim.edu/access-lab/)).
In 2021, I received a Ph.D. in Physics from the University of the Philippines, where my research focused on using computational simulations to study driving behavior in traffic models, and machine learning applications for traffic-related research.
My current research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning and artificial intelligence applied to multi-agent systems, including (but not limited to) traffic and transportation.
