# Fractal Dimension

Fractals are geometric features in which structures are similar when viewed at
small localized regions, or the entirety of the structure itself.
Fractals are said to be naturally occurring in nature, which is the motivation
of applying concepts of fractals in modelling physical systems.

One way to look at fractals is by their fractal dimension, given by
$$ D = \lim\_{\epsilon \to 0} \dfrac{\log{N}}{\log{1/\epsilon}}, $$
where $N$ is the number of boxes that contains the structure, and $\epsilon$ is
the size of the box.
As such, this method is called the box counting method.
This is useful for looking at the fractal dimensionality of two dimensional
images.

Suppose we want to look at the fractal dimension of this image:

![alt text]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/posts/fractals_files/lightning-fractal.jpg)

**In [1]:**

{% highlight python %}
%matplotlib inline
%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage import color

# img = color.rgb2gray(plt.imread('lightning-fractal.jpg'))

img = plt.imread('lightning-fractal.jpg')[:,:,0]/255.
plt.imshow(img>0.4, cmap="gray")
{% endhighlight %}

    <matplotlib.image.AxesImage at 0x6d2ecf8>

![svg]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/posts/fractals_files/fractals_1_1.svg)

The following lines of code will count the number of blocks containing the
structure $N$ for a given input of $\epsilon$.

**In [2]:**

{% highlight python %}
def count_N(img, epsilon):
N = 0
for i in range(0, img.shape[0], epsilon):
for j in range(0, img.shape[1], epsilon):
if i==img.shape[0]:
N += (np.sum(img[i:-1, j:j+epsilon])>0)
elif j==img.shape[1]:
N += (np.sum(img[i:i+epsilon, j:-1])>0)
else:
N += (np.sum(img[i:i+epsilon, j:j+epsilon])>0)

# print np.sum(img[i:i+epsilon, j:j+epsilon])>0

    return N

{% endhighlight %}

We will then plot $\log{N}$ with $\log{1/\epsilon}$ and if the slope of the
resulting plot, representing $D$ appoaches some finite value.

**In [3]:**

{% highlight python %}
epsilon_values = np.arange(200,0,-1)
N = [count_N(img, epsilon) for epsilon in epsilon_values]

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
x = np.log(1./epsilon_values)
y = np.log(N)
ax.scatter(x, y)
ax.set_ylabel(r"$\log{N}$")
ax.set_xlabel(r"$\log{1/\epsilon}$")
{% endhighlight %}

# Getting the fractal dimension

From the definition of the fractal dimension, we can see that it is simply the
slope of $\log{N}$ vs $\log{1/\epsilon}$ for large values of $1/\epsilon$. To
obtain this, it is best to fit a line at the end of the plot. In this case, we
will fit a line to the last 50 points, the slope of which is our fractal
dimension.

**In [4]:**

{% highlight python %}
from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

slope, intercept, r_value, p_value, std_err = stats.linregress(x[-50:],y[-50:])

print 'D = %s' % slope
{% endhighlight %}

    D = 1.93467964091

Hence, the fractal dimension of the image is $D=1.935$.
